Carl Meyer - Type-checked Python in the real world

You've heard about Python type annotations, but wondered if they're useful in
the real world? Worried you've got too much code and can't afford to annotate
it? Type-checked Python is here, it's for real, and it can help you catch bugs
and make your code easier to understand. Come learn from our experience
gradually typing a million-LOC production Python application!

Type checking solves real world problems in production Python systems. We'll
cover the benefits, how type checking in Python works, how to introduce it
gradually and sustainably in a production Python application, and how to measure
success and avoid common pitfalls. We'll even demonstrate how modern Python
typechecking goes hand-in-hand with duck-typing! Join us for a deep dive into
type-checked Python in the real world.
