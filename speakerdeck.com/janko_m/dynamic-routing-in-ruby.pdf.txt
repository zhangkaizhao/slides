# Dynamic routing in Ruby

Most of us are Rails developers, so we’re used to the way Rails routes requests. Most Ruby web frameworks also use a similar approach, but some are stepping off the rails.

Roda and Cuba route requests in what I would call a “dynamic” way, which I found very natural and flexible. I will compare the two approaches and demonstrate the advantages I see in dynamic routing.
